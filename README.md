# Simple Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn. It focuses on predicting CO2 emissions based on various vehicle features, with an emphasis on understanding the linear relationship between variables like engine size, cylinders, and CO2 emissions.

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
* Use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression
* Create, train, and test a linear regression model on real data

## Dataset
The analysis uses the `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv` dataset, which contains vehicle fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

## Key Features Analyzed
* **ENGINESIZE**: Size of the engine in Liters.
* **CYLINDERS**: Number of cylinders.
* **FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB**: Combined fuel consumption (city/highway) in L/100 km.
* **CO2EMISSIONS**: Carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning model implementation)

## How to Run the Notebook
1.  **Clone this repository** (or download the files).
2.  **Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.** If not, consider installing Anaconda which includes both.
3.  **Install the required libraries** if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4.  **Place the `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv` file** in the same directory as the `Simple-Linear-Regression.ipynb` notebook.
5.  **Open Jupyter Notebook** from your terminal in the project directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
6.  **Click on `Simple-Linear-Regression.ipynb`** to open and run the notebook cells.
